						<b> Faith: </b> My faith has always been an important aspect to me and my life. Spending time in prayer and being with the Lord has given me so much peace,
						tranquility, and rest. College has never been an easy journey, so having a strong faith has gotten me through a lot.

						<b> Sports: </b> All my life, I cannot remember a time where I didn't love sports. Arguably, my two favorite sports are basketball and tennis.
						I started playing basketball when I was 12 and it inspired my to major in Sport Management in the first place. I started playing tennis when I was 16,
						and it quickly became my favorite sport to play. The strategies are the most fascinating things, and it's the sport I play most today.
					</P>
					<ul> Some of my favorite basketball and tennis players include:
						<li>Wilt Chamberlain</li>
						<li>Novak Djokovic</li>
						<li>The Williams Sisters</li>
					</ul>

			<th style="width:30%">
					<P>
						<b> Music: </b> Music has been the most comfortable outlet that I have ever found. I have been writing songs since I was 11, and I have been writing consistently ever since.
						I have had my guitar since I was 12, but I didn't start consistently playing until I was 18. Most of the time, people can catch me around campus listening to music
						with my headphones on.
